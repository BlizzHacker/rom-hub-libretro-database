"""A parser for the clrmamepro DAT dialect libretro's `metadat/` uses.

    clrmamepro (
        name "Nintendo - Game Boy"
        version "2026.05.02"
    )

    game (
        name "Tetris (World) (Rev 1)"
        region "World"
        rom ( name "Tetris (World) (Rev 1).gb" size 32768 crc 46DF91AD
              md5 982ED5D2B12A0377EB14BCDC4123744E sha1 74591CC9... )
    )

**The two `name`s are different things, and keeping them apart is the
whole reason this file exists.** `game.name` is a catalogue title;
`rom.name` is a filename. `libretro-thumbnails` documented at length why
writing the second into a library as a game's name is harmful, and this
parser makes the distinction structural rather than a matter of care --
`Game.title` and `Game.roms[i]["name"]` cannot be confused for one
another, and a test pins that the filename is never what gets written.

They really do differ. In the Game Boy set, the game titled
`14 Juillet (World) (Fr)` has a rom named
`14 Juillet (World) (Fr) (Aftermarket) (Unl).gb`.

**Tokenising rather than pattern-matching per line.** A `rom (...)` entry
can wrap, a value can contain parentheses (`Tetris (World) (Rev 1)`), and
a game can carry several roms. A regex per line gets the easy 95% and
silently drops the rest; the tokeniser handles all of it and is about
thirty lines.
